# A-Pathfinding-Visualization

A* Path Finding Visualization implements the a* search algorithm using python. A path finding visualizer tool is being used to visualize the a star pathfinding algorithm as it runs. This a* pathfinding algorithm is an informed search algorithm which means it is much more efficient that standard algorithms like breadth first search or depth first search.
